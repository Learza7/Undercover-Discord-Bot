A simple Discord bot to play the Undercover Game.

Built with Discord.py.


Rules : All the players receive the same word except one that receives another word related to the first one (he is undercover).
        At each turn, players must say a word related to the word they have.
        Then each player vote for the person they think is undercover.
        Points are then distributed to the people that guessed right or to the intruder if nobody found him.  
        
A round could look like this :

This bot is fully autonomous and interactive : players receive their word through direct messages, they then write directly to the bot for each turn.
Ultimately they vote via reactions to the bot's message.
